# stats-ml-R

Just my small collection of R Scripts. 

* StatisticalLearning contains my solutions to the Statistical Learning online class given by StanfordEdu (now Lagunita?) that I completed a while ago (not sure if the content changed):
<a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about">found here</a>.

* AnalyticsEdge contains also some scripts of a edX class I started, but did not finish as it became too repetitive and I did not learn a whole lot there.
